## 🚨 Risk Management

### **Identified Risks & Mitigations**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Algorithm complexity | High | High | Start early, test extensively |
| Push notification compatibility | Medium | Medium | SMS fallback ready |
| Data migration issues | Low | High | Thorough testing, backup plan |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Profiling, caching, optimization |
| User adoption | Medium | High | Training, simple UI, support |

### **Contingency Plans**

```markdown
If behind schedule:
- Week 1-2: Can't slip, foundation critical
- Week 3: Can defer push notifications
- Week 4: Can reduce test coverage to 60%
- Week 5: Can do phased rollout

If major bugs found:
- Hotfix branch strategy
- Rollback plan ready
- Database backup every 4 hours
- Feature flags for quick disable
